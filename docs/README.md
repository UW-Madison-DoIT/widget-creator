Widget Creator is a web application that allows you to quickly create and test
widgets.  Widgets are used in
[uPortal-App-Frameworks applications](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DoIT/uw-frame)
and come complete with their own
[documentation](http://uw-madison-doit.github.io/uw-frame/widgets.html) on how
to configure and deploy.  This application allows a sandbox for rapid
development.  UW-Madison hosts a
[deployed instance](https://test.my.wisc.edu/widget-creator) for campus
developers to use.
